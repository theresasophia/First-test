This is the code used for the manuscript "Model selection and parameter estimation for dynamic epidemic models via iterated filtering: application to rotavirus in Germany " by T. Stocks, M. HÃ¶hle, T. Britton (2018) published in *Biostatistics* (https://doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxy057). Preprint version: [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/13/125880]

For calculations in *Data*, the data available on https://github.com/weidemannf/thesis_code/tree/master/Mode_inference_paperI by Felix Weidemann was used.

For inference methods the R package *pomp* (King et al. 2016)[https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v069i12] was used. Tutorials on how to use the package can be found here [https://kingaa.github.io/pomp/].
